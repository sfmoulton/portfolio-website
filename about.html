    <h3>My Previous Experience</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sky Media - AV Sales Executive</li>
        <p>I spent nearly 4 years working in the Media industry, with Sky Media (the advertising arm of Sky TV). This was a sales role, any my day-to-day focus was to drive incremental sales across my agency portfolio. This role really helped to improve my communication skills, but I felt that I wanted to utilise my skills gained at University, and embark on a change of career.</p>
        <li>Masters Degree in Chemistry - University of Liverpool (2010 -2014)</li>
        <p>My degree helped me to develop an analytical and evaluative way of thinking, which will prove helpful in my career in Software Development. I had to be precise, and use my problem-solving skills on a daily basis, so although I haven't pursued a career in this field, I know the transferable skills I gained in my time at University are invaluable.</p>
        <li>4 A-Levels (A - B grades)</li>
        <br>
        <li>9 GCSE's (A*- B grades)</li>
    </ul>
